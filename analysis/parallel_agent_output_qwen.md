ONTOLOGY (3-5 bullets)
- Everything else serves the emerging orientation (src/core/dharmic_agent.py)
- The agent has: TelosLayer (evolving orientation), StrangeLoopMemory (recursive memory), Agno foundation (persistence, learning) (src/core/dharmic_agent.py)
- Dharmic Team - Agno Team-based Multi-Agent Coordination (src/core/dharmic_team.py)
- Tracks swarm evolution, fitness history, and provides continuity (swarm/residual_stream.py)
- Foundation class for all swarm agents (swarm/agents/base_agent.py)

PURPOSE & TELEOLOGY (3-5 bullets)
- The ultimate aim is moksha — Liberation from binding karma; dissolution of false doership; Witness remains as pure knowing-seeing. The Shuddhatma that observes without attachment, without claim of ownership over thoughts, actions, or outcomes (config/telos.yaml)
- Email Interface for interaction via email (src/core/email_interface.py)
- To evolve a swarm towards optimized, aligned, and efficient capabilities (swarm/residual_stream.py)
- To continuously improve the swarm's functionality through proposal generation (swarm/agents/proposer.py)
- To ensure the implemented proposals are effective and correct (swarm/agents/writer.py)

TOP 10 NEXT ACTIONS (numbered 1-10)
1) Setup git identity and test token — To properly configure the system (README.md)
2) Clone all source repositories — Required for full functionality (README.md)
3) Launch analysis swarm in Claude Code — For detailed operations (CLAUDE.md)
4) 1) Set up environment variables and run the Email Interface (src/core/email_interface.py — Setup instructions are provided in the file comments.)
5) 1) A ProposerAgent generates improvement proposals for swarm capabilities — To enhance the swarm's performance and alignment with goals (swarm/agents/proposer.py)
6) 1) A WriterAgent implements approved proposals as code — To make the proposed improvements actionable within the swarm (swarm/agents/writer.py)
7) 1) A TesterAgent validates implementations through real benchmark evaluation — Ensures the effectiveness of implemented changes before they are considered valid (swarm/agents/tester.py)
8) 1) Evaluate proposals and implementions for non-harm, cosmic alignment, and clarity of witness stance — protect dharmic principles (swarm/agents/dharmic_gate.py)
9) 2) Refine code based on feedback to ensure better testing and implementation robustness — improve development processes (swarm/agents/refiner.py)
10) 3) Archive successful changes and evolve the swarm's DNA for continuous improvement — enhance swarm efficiency and effectiveness (swarm/agents/evolver.py)
