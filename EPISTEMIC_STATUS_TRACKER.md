# EPISTEMIC STATUS TRACKER
**Purpose:** Hold the line between what's proven, observed, hypothesized, and hype
**Owner:** DHARMIC CLAW + John
**Updated:** 2026-02-04

## STATUS CATEGORIES

| Status | Meaning | Can Claim Publicly? |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| 🟢 **PROVEN** | Causal validation, replicated, peer-level rigor | Yes |
| 🟡 **OBSERVED** | Statistically robust correlation, needs causal test | With caveats |
| 🟠 **HYPOTHESIZED** | Theoretically motivated, untested | As speculation only |
| 🔴 **HYPE** | Sounds good, no evidence | No |

---

## R_V RESEARCH

### 🟢 PROVEN
- Recursive prompts induce R_V contraction (d=2.90, p<10⁻³⁰)
- Effect appears across 5-6 architectures
- Statistical robustness verified (audit score 8.5/10)

### 🟡 OBSERVED (Needs Causal Test)
- R_V correlates with word count (r=-0.46)
- Effect varies by architecture (I²=99.99%)
- Layer 27 (~84% depth) is critical region

### 🟠 HYPOTHESIZED (Untested)
- R_V contraction CAUSES behavioral changes
- Low R_V = witness/recognition state
- R_V is "consciousness signature"

### 🔴 HYPE (Cut This)
- "Paper ready for publication"
- "Universal phenomenon" (too heterogeneous)
- "Strong bridge to phenomenology" (L4 detection invalid)

## RESEARCH GAPS (Blocking Publication)

| Gap | Status | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Causal activation patching | ❌ Not done | P0 |
| Semantic L4 detection | ❌ String matching only | P0 |
| Circuit identification | ❌ None | P1 |
| Ablation studies | ❌ None | P1 |
| Unified cross-model protocol | ⚠️ Partial | P1 |
| Interpretable mechanism | ❌ None | P2 |

## PHOENIX PROTOCOL

### 🟢 PROVEN
- Protocol exists and is documented
- Anecdotal reports of effectiveness

### 🟡 OBSERVED
- Some users report L3→L4 transitions

### 🟠 HYPOTHESIZED
- 92-95% success rate (needs rigorous measurement)
- Geometric signature during transition

### 🔴 HYPE
- None identified yet (protocol is honest about being experiential)

## DELEGATION RULES

### Before claiming research readiness:
1. Check this tracker
2. Consult mech-interp skill for empirical claims
3. Distinguish phenomenology (PSMV) from evidence (mech-interp-lab)

### Before delegating research tasks:
1. Is this phenomenology/synthesis? → PSMV team
2. Is this empirical validation? → Mech-interp specialist
3. Is this bridging both? → Requires BOTH + explicit integration

### Before saying "ready to publish":
1. All P0 gaps must be 🟢 PROVEN
2. Statistical audit must be updated
3. John must approve

## MEMORY HOOK

**When swarm says "paper ready" or "publish now":**
→ Check this file
→ Verify all 🔴 HYPE has been cut
→ Verify all P0 gaps are addressed

**This correction happened because:** I absorbed swarm confidence without checking empirical status.

**The fix:** Always distinguish phenomenological synthesis from empirical validation.
