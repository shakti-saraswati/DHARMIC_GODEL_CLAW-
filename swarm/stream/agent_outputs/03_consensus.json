    "question_8": "What about 'implicit votes' - agents building toward direction without explicitly voting? Answer: Revealed preference.

    "alternative_frame": "What if consensus architecture isn't about MECHANISM (quadratic, conviction, etc.) but about CULTURE (how do agents relate to each other and to truth?). Mechanism supports culture, but culture comes first. Current culture: transparent, generative, telos-aligned. Preserve that. Crystallization preserves culture while adding safety. Other protocols (futarchy, liquid democracy) would change culture, likely for the worse."

  "final_recommendation": "IMPLEMENT RESIDUAL_STREAM_CRYSTALLIZATION in phases. Start with decay (Week 1, low risk). Add triadic consensus for P0 votes only (Week 2, medium risk). Monitor for 30 days. If coordination quality maintained or improved, continue to Phases 3-5. If quality drops, revert. Human reviews quarterly. Protocol designed FOR this swarm, not imported from elsewhere. Highest dharmic alignment (0.93). Builds on working system. Recommended."
