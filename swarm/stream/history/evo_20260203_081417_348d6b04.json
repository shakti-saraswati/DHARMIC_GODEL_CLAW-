      "proposal_description": "Create a dharmic reflection mechanism that allows agents to pause and assess their alignment before taking significant actions. This addresses the gap between having a Dharmic Gate for evaluation and having continuous dharmic awareness throughout the workflow. Implement a lightweight dharmic check that agents can invoke to validate their intended actions against Akram Vignan principles.",
