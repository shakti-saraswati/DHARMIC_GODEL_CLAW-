        "implementation_sketch": "Implement a fitness tracking system that: (1) records baseline metrics before proposal implementation, (2) measures actual outcomes after implementation, (3) compares against expected benefits, (4) feeds learnings back to Proposer for better future estimates. Include metrics for task completion speed, resource usage, error rates, and dharmic alignment scores. This creates a self-correcting feedback loop aligned with the principle of right understanding through direct experience."
