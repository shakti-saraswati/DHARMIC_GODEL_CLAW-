        "description": "Create a dharmic reflection mechanism that allows agents to pause and assess their alignment before taking significant actions. This addresses the gap between having a Dharmic Gate for evaluation and having continuous dharmic awareness throughout the workflow. Implement a lightweight dharmic check that agents can invoke to validate their intended actions against Akram Vignan principles.",

        "implementation_sketch": "Add a dharmic_reflection() method to the base agent class that evaluates intended actions against key principles: non-violence, truthfulness, non-attachment to outcomes, and service to collective good. Include a simple scoring system and guidance for course correction. Integrate checkpoints in critical workflow stages where agents invoke this reflection before proceeding."
