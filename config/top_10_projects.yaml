# Notes
# - This list compiled from 10 research agents analyzing 32,000+ files
# - Projects ordered by strategic importance AND dependencies
# - P1-P3 are the foundation - everything else builds on them
# - P9 (Unified Memory) is the biggest blocker for other projects
# - Funding/sustainability (P7) is critical path for long-term viability
# - TRACKING: Both code AND docs must advance - no orphan code, no orphan docs
