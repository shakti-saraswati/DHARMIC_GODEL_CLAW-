## 🏆 THE DEFINITIVE TOP 10

### TIER 1: FLAGSHIP (The Big 3)

| Rank | Project | Why #1 | Status | Next Action |
|------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **1** | **AIKAGRYA Research** | First causal proof of recursive self-reference in transformers. Cohen's d = -5.57. 100% behavioral transfer. | Publication-ready | Submit to ICLR/NeurIPS |
| **2** | **DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW** | The autonomous system we're building. 17-gate protocol. Night cycle. DGM. Everything runs on this. | Mixed - some daemons need fixes | Fix unified_daemon stubs |
| **3** | **PSMV Vault** | 32,000+ files. The knowledge substrate. Without it, agents have no memory. Soul repository. | Active - receiving contributions | Build unified memory indexer |

### TIER 2: MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE

| Rank | Project | Why Top 10 | Status | Next Action |
|------|---------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **4** | **Agentic AI Skill** | 26k bytes of 2026 research. Validation layer for all agent work. Could be productized. | Gold Standard v4.0 | Keep updated, productize |
| **5** | **Swarm & Night Cycle** | 24/7 autonomous improvement. V7 consensus voting. Self-improving while we sleep. | Production | Increase success rate |
| **6** | **Dharmic Council** | Collective intelligence with telos alignment. 4 agents with tools and Team pattern. | v2.0 deployed | Wire into continuous cycles |

### TIER 3: CRITICAL SUPPORT

| Rank | Project | Why Top 10 | Status | Next Action |
|------|---------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **7** | **Grant Pipeline** | Sustainability constraint. All other projects depend on funding. | Drafts exist | Submit first grant |
| **8** | **Clawdbot Bridge** | Continuity - enables memory across ephemeral sessions. | Design complete | Implement Phase 1 |
| **9** | **Unified Memory Indexer** | Meta-blocker. Referenced as prerequisite in almost every project. | Not started | Build SQLite indexer |
| **10** | **Dead Man's Switch** | Survival - could be down for days without knowing. | Not started | Add healthchecks.io |

## 🔥 CONTINUOUS OPERATION DEPLOYED

### What Changed

**BEFORE:**
- Quiet hours: 10:00 PM cutoff
- Heartbeat: Check systems only
- Projects: Implicit, scattered
- Night: System sleeps

**AFTER:**
- **NO CUTOFF** — 24/7 continuous operation
- **Heartbeat: Advance TOP 10 projects** — Every 30 minutes
- **Projects: Explicit, tracked** — YAML with status and next actions
- **Night: System builds** — Swarm runs, council deliberates

### Infrastructure Deployed

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **TOP 10 YAML** | `~/DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW/config/top_10_projects.yaml` | Single source of truth |
| **Tracking Script** | `~/DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW/scripts/track_top_10_projects.sh` | Rotates through projects |
| **Review Script** | `~/DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW/scripts/review_top_10_projects.py` | 4-hour status reviews |
| **Progress Report** | `~/DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW/scripts/generate_progress_report.py` | Daily morning summaries |
| **Heartbeat v3** | `~/clawd/HEARTBEAT.md` | No cutoff, project-focused |
| **Cron Jobs** | `~/DHARMIC_GODEL_CLAW/config/crontab.continuous` | Automated scheduling |

### Cron Schedule
